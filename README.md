**SPRING EXAMPLE**

Sample maven project for spring boot applications using java and kotlin languages.
It follows hexagonal architecture principles (https://netflixtechblog.com/ready-for-changes-with-hexagonal-architecture-b315ec967749)
and uses different testing techniques, especially for the data layer classes.
It uses some basic concepts of functional programming (like monads) using arrow kotlin library.
Moreover, it shows usages of other less common technologies (like NoSQL database).
It contains also a Jenkinsfile to allow continuous integration with jenkins, and 
a Dockerfile that can be used after the build stage to build a docker image.

**HOW TO BUILD**

Download docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.
Build inside a docker container (basically you don't even need Maven installed locally) 
by using the .sh script typing: `./build.sh`.

**HOW TO RUN**

Run using `docker compose up` command and start application locally.
